### What I learned

While completing this challenge, I learnt how to use a flex box and CSS grid to create a responsible website. I learned how to create responsible cards from this challenge, starting with mobile, moving on to tablets, and finishing with desktop. I also learned how to name the parent and the child of that parent using the BEM naming convention.
